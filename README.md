MW2-Mod-Collection
==================

JuggaNOT(never finished) - a juggernaut based game that chooses a player at random to become a 'juggernaut', the remaining players
must fight to kill this assigned player. After the juggernaut is killed, the player who killed it becomes the new juggernaut for 
the next round

SnipeMOD - A custom version of iSnipe written for a MW2 clan called 'Plan' that hosted quick-scoping servers.

Freezetag - One of my favorite mods I ever wrote. Similar to a team deathmatch with an added twist. Instead of players 'dying' they
are instead frozen in their current location. Team members can unfreeze their teammates with a delay. First team to freeze all 
of the opposing players wins!

Gungame - a simple gungame mod, like the one found in some of the other Call of Duty franchises.
